# On-Chip-Clock-Multiplier (PLL) using OSU 180nm PDK  | VSD
This particular project is enodorsed and faciliated by VSD, and emphasizes on the development of an 'On-Chip-Clock-Multiplier' or PLL using OSU 180nm PDK. It comes as part of a 24-hour long tutorial/workshop initiated on 19th October, 2021.

### Introduction 

* Intellectual Property (IP): Pre-defined logical cells that are not built from scratch but are rather bought from IP vendors so that they can be used directly on a chip/core. RAM and ROM are few examples of IPs. This helps to reduce design and testing time significantly.
